To consolidate subsidiaries in your consolidation company, you should use
'Consolidation : consolidate' wizard in Accounting > Adviser.

You have to select the month until which every account move will be processed,
and select if you want to consolidate all the moves or only posted ones.

This will generate a journal entry in YTD (Year-To-Date) mode on your
consolidation company for each subsidiary. Those entries are flagged as
'auto_reverse', so they will actually be reversed when you run the
consolidation the next time.

The generated journal entries are unposted, allowing you to modify or delete it to
run the consolidation again.
