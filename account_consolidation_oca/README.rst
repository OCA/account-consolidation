This module extends the functionality of accounting to allow you to consolidate
journal items in a consolidation company.

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

To install this module, you need the modules `currency_monthly_rate` to be
available in your system.

To configure this module, you need to flag a company as Consolidation in the
Accounting settings.

Then, you should define a consolidation difference account and a consolidation
journal on the consolidation company, and create consolidation profiles for
each subsidiary you want to consolidate.

For each subsidiary to consolidate, make sure the related partner of the
company has no company_id defined.

Afterwards, you should define a consolidation account from your consolidation
company, on every active account of the subsidiaries.

You can then use the 'Consolidation : Checks' wizard in Accounting > Adviser to
ensure every active account of your subsidiaries are set, and company partners
have no company defined.

Make sure you also defined currency rates and monthly currency rates on the
consolidation company for the currencies of your subsidiaries, as P&L accounts
are consolidated using monthly rates and B.S accounts using standard 'spot'
rates.


Known issues
============

* Consolidation manager has access to all the settings, or he wouldn't be able
  to configure the module.
* Functional mapping of accounts is not tested. If no consolidation entries
  are generated, it's probably because the balance of mapped accounts is 0
* Correctness of companies hierarchy in profile rest on user

Usage
=====

To consolidate subsidiaries in your consolidation company, you should use
'Consolidation : consolidate' wizard in Accounting > Accounting.

You have to select the month until which every account move will be processed,
and select if you want to consolidate all the moves or only posted ones.

This will generate a journal entry in YTD (Year-To-Date) mode on your
consolidation company for each subsidiary. Those entries are flagged as
'auto_post', so they will actually be reversed when you run the
consolidation the next time.

The generated journal entries are unposted, allowing you to modify or delete it to
run the consolidation again.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Implement a distinction on analytic accounts
